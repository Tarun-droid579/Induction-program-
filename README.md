My Experience @ GNDEC

Day 1 – A Memorable Beginning

The first day at GNDEC felt like the start of a new chapter in my life. All CSE and IT students gathered in the beautifully decorated auditorium. There was a sense of excitement mixed with curiosity as we waited for the sessions to begin.

The host welcomed our first speaker, Harpreet Ma’am, whose warm and motivating words instantly made us feel like we were already part of the GNDEC family.

Our Principal Sir then addressed us, encouraging us to make the best use of every opportunity this institution offers. Following this, the NSET Director shared the proud history of GNDEC, highlighting its 68 glorious years, with the first 36 years dedicated to laying a strong foundation.

That day, I learned an important life lesson:

> “Don’t wait for opportunities – create them and grab them when they come your way.”



Later, an ADGP Officer spoke about the power of karma and how good deeds always bring rewards, even if they come late. His ability to speak for an hour without any preparation amazed us.

One piece of advice that stayed with me was:

> “Never be easily impressed; there is always more to learn.”



Students who actively participated received chocolates. Although I didn’t get one that day, I walked away with countless valuable lessons. From that moment, I promised myself that I would never let opportunities slip by again.

Day 2 – Stepping Out of My Comfort Zone

On the second day, Dr. Arvind Dhingra Sir gave me a push to break out of my reserved nature. He invited 11 boys and 11 girls to come up on stage for a fun team strategy game. Determined not to miss out, I volunteered and participated confidently.

Through this activity, I introduced myself to new peers, learned teamwork, and realized how interaction builds confidence.

Later, Dr. H.S. Rai (Controller of Examination) shared his refreshing perspective on exams—viewing them not as obstacles but as opportunities to showcase our abilities.

The most exciting part came when Dr. Rai invited 10 students to work with him—not for him. I was lucky to be one of the selected students, and soon our group expanded to 50 members. From just the second day of college, I got the chance to learn about the latest technologies—an opportunity that felt truly special.

Day 3 – Learning, Interaction, and Leadership

The third day was equally enriching, filled with knowledge, interaction, and opportunities to lead.

Universal Human Values – A Path to True Happiness

The first lecture introduced us to Universal Human Values, focusing on what it truly means to live a happy and content life. We discussed how happiness and inner satisfaction influence our decisions and everyday actions. Sharing real-life scenarios made the session deeply relatable and meaningful.

Canva Insights – Unleashing Creativity

Next, we explored the world of Canva, a powerful tool for creating impactful designs. It opened up new possibilities for presenting ideas creatively and effectively.

CodeGNE Leadership – Taking Initiative

The day concluded with discussions around CodeGNE, a platform that encourages students to take initiative and lead. It inspired me to actively participate in communities that foster learning and growth.

Key Takeaways from My First Three Days at GNDEC

✔ Opportunities are everywhere – but only for those who grab them.
✔ Interaction is the first step toward growth.
✔ True learning comes when we step out of our comfort zone.
✔ Happiness and self-satisfaction are as important as academic success.

These three days taught me lessons that go beyond books—lessons about life, leadership, and the power of seizing every chance to grow.
